    <h1>How to Make Sourdough Bread</h1>
    <p>This is based on the Tartine Method and will make two loaves.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Strong white flour</li>
      <li>Whole wheat flour</li>
      <li>Sourdough starter</li>
      <li>Water</li>
      <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Equipment</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Large mixing bowl w/spoon</li>
      <li>Medium mixing bowl for combining water</li>
      <li>Large glass jar</li>
      <li>Bench scraper</li>
      <li>Proofing basket</li>
      <li>Dutch oven</li>
      <li>Kitchen scale</li>
      <li>Thermometer</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Day 1: Making the leaven</h2>
    <p>In the evening, gather the ingredients and equipment.</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Place glass jar on scale, set it to zero</li>
      <li>Add 100g of strong white flour</li>
      <li>Add 100g of whole wheat flour</li>
      <li>Add 200g of water</li>
      <li>Add 1 tbsp of starter</li>
      <li>Mix well, cover, and place a rubber band on the jar as a marker</li>
      <li>
        Let it sit overnight. The temperature will affect when the leaven is
        ready, so adjust accordingly
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Day 2: Putting it all together</h2>
    <p>
      In the morning, check to see if the leaven has doubled. Put it in a warm
      spot if it needs more time. You can begin the mixing process when it's
      ready (it should float).
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Place large mixing bowl on scale and set to zero</li>
      <li>Add between 600-800g of strong white flour</li>
      <li>Add remainder of whole wheat flour to total 1kg</li>
      <li>Place medium mixing container on scale and set to zero</li>
      <li>Add 600g of water</li>
      <li>Add 200g of leaven</li>
      <li>Set some leaven aside as your new starter and refrigerate</li>
      <li>Mix leaven and water together, add to flour</li>
      <li>
        Combine the mix, let it sit for 25-30 minutes at approx. 78°F (26°C)
      </li>
      <li>
        After the initial rest period, add 50g of water and 20g of salt and mix
        thoroughly. Let it sit for another 25-30 minutes.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Stretch and Fold</h2>
    <p>
      After the second rest, stretch and fold the dough in the bowl. Do this
      every 30 minutes for approx. 3 hours. In between folds, cover with a damp
      towel. Maintain the dough temperature at around 78°F (26°C).
    </p>
    <h3>Shaping the dough</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        When the stretching and folding is complete, place mixture out onto a
        floured surface
      </li>
      <li>Divide the dough in half</li>
      <li>Spread out the dough</li>
      <li>Fold it together from the sides</li>
      <li>Bring it together into a ball</li>
      <li>Gently form into a tight ball</li>
      <li>
        Let it sit for 30 minutes and repeat the shaping process (spreading,
        folding, shaping etc.)
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the dough seam side up in a floured proofing basket, cover and
        refrigerate overnight
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Day 2: Baking</h2>
    <p>
      Preheat the oven to 500°F (260°C) with the Dutch oven inside for at least
      one hour.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Dust the bottom of the loaf with corn flour</li>
      <li>Place the loaf in the Dutch oven, score the top</li>
      <li>Cover with lid and cook for 20 minutes</li>
      <li>Remove the lid and lower the temperature to 400°F (200°C)</li>
      <li>Cook for another 20 minutes without the lid</li>
      <li>Remove from the oven and let it cool on a wire rack</li>
      <li>Serve after a resting period (approx. 1-2 hrs.)</li>
    </ol>
